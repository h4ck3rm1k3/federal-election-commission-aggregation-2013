    Campaign Finance Analyst  Reports Analysis Division  Federal Election Commission
    \ 999 E Street, NW  Washington, DC 20463    ID:  C00155952  REFERENCE:  Amended
    12 Day Pre-General Report 10/01/2012-10/17/2013, Received 1/31/2013    Dear Mr.
    Jones:    In regards to your letter dated April 26, 2013, please note that the
    excessive contributions identified in your letter have been refunded.  The checks
    for the refunds were sent out and will be reported on May 8, 2013.      The Committee
    sought and obtained current and valid U.S. Passports from the donors with foreign
    addresses identified in your letter, 11 C.F.R. 110.20(a)(7).    Payments for Per
    Diem-Travel/Meals were made as part of a committee technology per diem policy
    and were not petty cash payments.       Please note that all payments for exempt
    activities complied with Commission regulations.  Each activity was undertaken
    by volunteers and the committee did not use any funds received by the committee
    from a national committee nor were any funds earmarked for any exempt activities.
